An Array is fundamental and linear data structure that stores items at contiguous locations. 

Random Access: i-th item can be access in O(1) time as we have the base address and every item or reference is of same size.
Cache Friendliness: Since Items/references are stored at contiguous locations, we get the advantage of locality of reference.

Arrays are mainly used to build other data structures Like stack, queue,HashTable...etc.
